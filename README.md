# COVID-19-in-India-A-Data-Driven-Analysis

Corona Virus (Covid-19) data analysis project use two datasets to track the spread of COVID-19 and the progress of the vaccination campaign in India. The first dataset contains daily data on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in each state or union territory and in second dataset contains information on the number of doses administered, the number of sessions conducted, and the number of people vaccinated by age group and gender.

This data analysis project has the potential to make a significant impact on the fight against COVID-19 in India. By providing insights into the spread of the virus and the progress of the vaccination campaign, the analysis can help to save lives and protect public health.

**The analysis will focus on the following questions:**

•	Which states or union territories have been the most affected?       
•	How has the vaccination campaign progressed over time?      
•	Which age groups and genders have been vaccinated at the highest rates?

**Here are some additional details about the two datasets that will be used in this project:**

•	The COVID-19 dataset is available from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website.    
•	The vaccination dataset is available from the COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard website.

The analysis will be conducted using the Python programming language and library like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. The results of the analysis will be presented in a report and in a series of visualizations.

I am confident that this data analysis project will make a significant contribution to the fight against COVID-19 in India. I am excited to get started and I look forward to sharing the results of my analysis with you.
