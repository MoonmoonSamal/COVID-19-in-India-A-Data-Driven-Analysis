***COVID-19: The Global Health Crisis***

Researchers first isolated a coronavirus in 1937. They found a coronavirus responsible for an infectious bronchitis virus in birds that had the ability to devastate poultry stocks. Scientists first found evidence of human coronaviruses (HCoV) in the 1960s in the noses of people with the common cold. Two human coronaviruses are responsible for a large proportion of common colds: OC43 and 229E. The name “coronavirus” comes from the crown-like projections on their surfaces. “Corona” in Latin means “halo” or “crown.” Among humans, coronavirus infections most often occur during the winter months and early spring. People regularly become ill with a cold due to a coronavirus and may catch the same one about 4 months later. This is because coronavirus antibodies do not last for a long time. Also, the antibodies for one strain of coronavirus may be ineffective against another one.

COVID-19 In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started monitoring the outbreak of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness now known as COVID-19. Authorities first identified the virus in Wuhan, China. More than 74,000 people have contracted the virus in China. Health authorities have identified many other people with COVID-19 around the world, including many in the United States. On January 31, 2020, the virus passed from one person to another in the U.S. The World Health Organization (WHO) have declared a public health emergency relating to COVID-19. Information on the virus is scarce at present. In the past, respiratory conditions that develop from coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, have spread through close contacts.

***About Project***

Corona Virus (Covid-19) data analysis project use two datasets to track the spread of COVID-19 and the progress of the vaccination campaign in India. The first dataset contains daily data on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in each state or union territory and in second dataset contains information on the number of doses administered, the number of sessions conducted, and the number of people vaccinated by age group and gender.

This data analysis project has the potential to make a significant impact on the fight against COVID-19 in India. By providing insights into the spread of the virus and the progress of the vaccination campaign, the analysis can help to save lives and protect public health.

**The analysis will focus on the following questions:**

•	Which states or union territories have been the most affected?       
•	How has the vaccination campaign progressed over time?      
•	Which age groups and genders have been vaccinated at the highest rates?

**Here are some additional details about the two datasets that will be used in this project:**

•	The COVID-19 dataset is available from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website.    
•	The vaccination dataset is available from the COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard website.

The analysis will be conducted using the Python programming language and library like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. The results of the analysis will be presented in a report and in a series of visualizations.

I am confident that this data analysis project will make a significant contribution to the fight against COVID-19 in India. I am excited to get started and I look forward to sharing the results of my analysis with you.

Thank You.
